# But how do I cite my people?

You know clickbait is effective...

If you already read the previous chapter, I hope you already found about the _Insert citation_ button in visual mode. There you go. Next chapter.

## But can I use my Zotero references?

While preparing this workflow I got a few times this question. Luckily, the answer is yes. If you have the Zotero app installed in your computer, you should have already found the Zotero section in the _Insert citation_ menu. Anyway, go check [Zotero citations](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/positron/visual-editor.html#zotero-citations) if you need more details. 

## But do I really need to install the Zotero app?

Even if you don't have the Zotero app installed and you only use the web version, you could still sync Positron with your Zotero account, but that might take [a few setup steps](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/positron/visual-editor.html#zotero-web-api).

## Surely there must be a faster way to cite

There is! If you're editing in visual mode, write `@` and you'll automatically get a searchable list of references to choose from:

If you write `@knuth84` directly, the output citation style might not be the one you expect. You can also try putting it inside brackets like `[@knuth84]` to see if there's any difference.
