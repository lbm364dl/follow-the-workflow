## Pushing our changes

After committing, we now have our changes in local git history, but we should
probably also add them to the remote GitHub repository. We do this using the command
```
git push origin <name-of-branch>
```
Now you should be able to see your changes in your own branch from GitHub itself,
you just need to select your own branch instead of the `main` one.

You should remember to push your changes regularly to the remote repository.
Otherwise you risk having a bunch of code features in your local computer that
could be lost if something happened to it. This is aligned with the previous
suggestion of creating many smaller commits as opposed to giant ones, so that
you can also push them more frequently.
