## Creating our own branch

After the pull, we are now safely up to date with the remote changes. Now it is
time to learn how to create our own 'branch', from which we will start working
on new code. We use the following command:
```
git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
```

```{r, fig.alt="Using branch creation command", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/branch_creation_command.png")
```

The command `git checkout <name-of-branch>` is used to change from one branch
to another (so that you will now see the files and changes that are in that
branch). Additionally, if we add the `-b` option, it will create the branch with
the given name if it does not already exist, which is our case in this example.
The branch name should be something like `author/name-of-branch`. Thus, some
common practices for naming your branches (and that we should follow) are:

- They do not contain caps (all lowercase)
- Words are separated with dashes (`-`)
- The name includes the author and some descriptive name separated by a slash (`/`)
- The descriptive name should ideally start with an action (a verb) in imperative
style (fix, create, test...).

If Ermenegildo wants to create some code for preprocessing bilateral trade data,
an acceptable branch name could be `ermenegildo/preprocess-bilateral-trade-data`.
